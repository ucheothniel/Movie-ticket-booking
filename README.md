# Movie-ticket-booking

This project is a vanilla Javascript based project which emulates a movie/cinema seat and ticket booking website.

It was designed from scratch with no frame work, only the web development trio HTML, CSS and Javascript.

In this project majority of the controls and logic behind how the seats are selected, movies selected, seats count,
price total price calculation and retrieving of already selected iteams on the UI from local storage even
after refreshing the page, was done in the javascript.

The desgin aspect was done with CSS.

No API was used as well and this code can be run using any local IDE. Just download and run a local host on your comuter.

Appreciation to my UDEMY instructor Brad Traversy for all the knowledge and insight during this project. 

You can go through my comments especially in the JS code as well as the text file attached to this repository.
You can also replace the background image of this project to any image if your choice, Just ensure to add the file path accordingly
in the CSS code. 

Thank you :D
